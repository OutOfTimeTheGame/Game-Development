The original idea was to have the levels go Egyptian, Roman, Medieval and Future "2084" As noted by Angelika this is a linear path in time. We will be changing this in the GDD "Games Design Document" so that they are in a non linear path 

We were maybe going to add in a navigational pointer system showing where the player was to go but Steven decided it wasn't a good idea as it would take up too much time.

There was going to be a lives system in the game but we decided not to incorporate this as a lives system is kind of unfair in certain game types
