week 3 - I have joined the team and they walked me through their ideas about the game.
week 4 - Mostly, I was focused on the main character 
what exactly was made:
-Dean's look
-Dean's animations ( walking, idle, easter egg)
week 5 - I was absent at the classes but I have created an enemy number 1
week 6 - Me and Steven were talking a lot about the lightning and thinking about new ideas which will make our game more alive.
Enemy number 2 for Egypt stage were created.
